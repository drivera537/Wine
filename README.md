# Wine

Vision: A data base that seeks to help users navigate to the best wines to try by proximity to location, highest reviews and right price. 
Objectives
1. Remove incomplete rows that would sku ratios
2. Link together the Google address data
3. Group data by location and winery for analysis
4. Laguage:  Python | Data Manipulation and Visualization: Pandas, GMaps and MatPlotlib | Other:  Jupyter Notebook, Google API

Future Goals:
1. Refine the zip code locator to recommend best wineries by location

2. Create a system for examining the tasters for bias in scoring

3. Fine tune the rank v. pricing to consider other variables like prestige of the Winery and proximity to location to make recommendations

4. Include users preference and make recommendations that align with the tasters preference in scoring
